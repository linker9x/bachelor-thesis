This deep learning package is an extension of the Deep Learning Tutorials (www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/).

This package is composed of four parts as follows.

1. Modified methods from Deep Learning Tutorials:
Multi-class logistic/softmax regression: logistic_sgd.py
Multilayer perceptrons (MLP): mlp.py
Stacked denoising autoencoder (SdA): SdA.py
Stacked contractive autoencoder (ScA): ScA.py
Restricted Boltzman machine (RBM): rbm.py
Deep belief network (DBN, stacked restricted Boltzman machine): DBN.py
Convolutional neural network (CNN): convolutional_mlp.py

2. Our deep-feature-selection models:
Deep feature selection based on MLP: deep_feat_select_mlp.py
Deep feature selection based on ScA: deep_feat_select_ScA.py
Deep feature selection based on DBN: deep_feat_select_DBN.py

3. A utility module for classification is included. 
This module is named classification.py.
See the beginning of this file for usage.

4. Examples:
For every methods in 1 and 2, an example is provided to demonstrate how to use it.
The file names of these examples are main_[module_name].py
